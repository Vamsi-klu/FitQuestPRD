# FitQuest - Interactive Product Requirements Document (PRD)

This repository contains a single-page, interactive web application designed to present the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for **FitQuest**, a conceptual fitness tracking app. The goal of this project is to transform a traditionally static document into an engaging, easy-to-navigate, and visually appealing experience.

## About the Project

This application reimagines how product requirements are presented. Instead of a linear text document, this project uses a modern web interface to break down the PRD into logical, thematic sections. This allows stakeholders, developers, and designers to quickly access and understand the specific requirements relevant to them.

### Key Features

  * **Single-Page Application (SPA):** A fluid and fast user experience with no page reloads.
  * **Interactive Sidebar Navigation:** Easily jump between different sections of the PRD, from UI/UX principles to backend performance benchmarks.
  * **Data Visualization:** Key concepts, such as supported activities and gamification strategies, are visualized using **Chart.js** to make data more digestible.
  * **Dynamic Content Display:** Content sections are dynamically shown or hidden based on user navigation, keeping the interface clean and focused.
  * **Simulated AI Feature:** Includes an interactive demonstration of the "Dynamic Challenge Generator," which simulates a call to the Gemini API to showcase a core feature of the FitQuest app concept.
  * **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and optimized for viewing on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices, thanks to **Tailwind CSS**.

## Technology Stack

This project was built using standard web technologies with a focus on simplicity and performance.

  * **HTML5:** For the core structure and content.
  * **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling and creating a responsive layout.
  * **Vanilla JavaScript:** To handle all interactivity, including navigation and the AI feature simulation.
  * **Chart.js:** For creating the dynamic and responsive charts.
